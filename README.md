# Design Choices

## Colour Scheme

#F1DFA2 (Cream): This soft cream color forms the background of various sections, offering a warm and inviting ambiance that's easy on the eyes.
#FCF6E4 (Off-White): Used for background highlights and to create a clean, uncluttered look, enhancing the content's readability.
Accent Colours:
#F8DA2E (Sunflower Yellow): Used for menu title to draw attention.
#519CEB (Sky Blue): Indicates active page links and button hovers, adding a refreshing contrast against the warmer tones.
Text:
#000000 (Black): Provides excellent readability against the lighter background shades, used for the majority of the text.
This colour scheme was selected to balance warmth and energy, creating an inviting digital environment that's both aesthetically pleasing and functional. The use of contrasting colours for interactive elements ensures users can easily navigate and interact with the website.


## Typography

For the website, I chose two main fonts to make it look modern and easy to read. I used 'Work Sans' for the main text because it's clean and straightforward, which helps with reading on screens. Then, for the titles in the footer, I picked 'Dancing Script' because it's a bit more decorative and adds some personality, especially for important sections. These choices help make the site feel welcoming and easy to navigate.

## Logo and Favicon

Logo is generated by dalle-3 using the prompt :  "generate a logo for a mediterranean  restaurant, the name of the restaurant is ege"

Favicons created using: https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/). For other devices wireframes were not seen as a necessity. Wireframes for other pages were not developed before development.

## Flow Diagram

## Database Plan

The database for the restaurant website consists of four main models: Table, Reservation, SpecialRequest, and MenuItem, along with an Email model for managing emails. Altough the email setup could not implemented due to time constraints.

Table: Represents restaurant tables, specifying their number, capacity, and location (Garden, Bar, or Dining Room). This helps manage seating arrangements.
Reservation: Links customers (registered or not) to table bookings, recording details like email, phone, name, date, time, number of guests, and table location. It allows for tracking both pending and confirmed reservations.
SpecialRequest: Captures any special requests associated with a reservation, noting if it's approved. This enhances customer service by attending to specific needs.
MenuItem: Details the food items on the menu, categorized by type (e.g., Starter, Meze, Main Course), including descriptions, prices, availability, and images. This model aids in menu management and presentation.
Email: Handles the creation of emails for different purposes, with fields for recipient, subject, body, and template type, automating communication with customers.

The database diagram was created using https://dbdiagram.io/.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Giving all buttons a hover state to enhance the user experience by making the navigation elements responsive, ensuring that users are aware of clickable elements and encouraging engagement with the website's content.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the website - sans serif fonts are known by their easy readibility.
* Making sure that there is sufficient colour contrast.
