## Site Objectives

The main goal of the Ege Restaurant website was to make it simple for customers to book tables online, offering clear options for reservation details. It was also designed to showcase the menu in an easily updatable format for the admin, allowing for quick changes to menu items or prices. Additionally, the site aims to improve the management of reservations, giving the admin a clear overview of booking details, such as the number of reservations and specific customer requests, enhancing the overall efficiency and customer service experience.

# User Experience/UX

# Design Choices

## Colour Scheme

#F1DFA2 (Cream): This soft cream color forms the background of various sections, offering a warm and inviting ambiance that's easy on the eyes.
#FCF6E4 (Off-White): Used for background highlights and to create a clean, uncluttered look, enhancing the content's readability.
Accent Colours:
#F8DA2E (Sunflower Yellow): Used for menu title to draw attention.
#519CEB (Sky Blue): Indicates active page links and button hovers, adding a refreshing contrast against the warmer tones.
Text:
#000000 (Black): Provides excellent readability against the lighter background shades, used for the majority of the text.
This colour scheme was selected to balance warmth and energy, creating an inviting digital environment that's both aesthetically pleasing and functional. The use of contrasting colours for interactive elements ensures users can easily navigate and interact with the website.


## Typography

For the website, I chose two main fonts to make it look modern and easy to read. I used 'Work Sans' for the main text because it's clean and straightforward, which helps with reading on screens. Then, for the titles in the footer, I picked 'Dancing Script' because it's a bit more decorative and adds some personality, especially for important sections. These choices help make the site feel welcoming and easy to navigate.

## Logo and Favicon

Logo is generated by dalle-3 using the prompt :  "generate a logo for a mediterranean  restaurant, the name of the restaurant is ege"

Favicons created using: https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/). For other devices wireframes were not seen as a necessity. Wireframes for other pages were not developed before development.

## Flow Diagram

## Database Plan

The database for the restaurant website consists of four main models: Table, Reservation, SpecialRequest, and MenuItem, along with an Email model for managing emails. Altough the email setup could not implemented due to time constraints.

Table: Represents restaurant tables, specifying their number, capacity, and location (Garden, Bar, or Dining Room). This helps manage seating arrangements.
Reservation: Links customers (registered or not) to table bookings, recording details like email, phone, name, date, time, number of guests, and table location. It allows for tracking both pending and confirmed reservations.
SpecialRequest: Captures any special requests associated with a reservation, noting if it's approved. This enhances customer service by attending to specific needs.
MenuItem: Details the food items on the menu, categorized by type (e.g., Starter, Meze, Main Course), including descriptions, prices, availability, and images. This model aids in menu management and presentation.
Email: Handles the creation of emails for different purposes, with fields for recipient, subject, body, and template type, automating communication with customers.

The database diagram was created using https://dbdiagram.io/.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Giving all buttons a hover state to enhance the user experience by making the navigation elements responsive, ensuring that users are aware of clickable elements and encouraging engagement with the website's content.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the website - sans serif fonts are known by their easy readibility.
* Making sure that there is sufficient colour contrast.

# **Deployment**

Here is the link to the deployed project. [Ege Restaurant]().

## **Create Repository**

First, create a new repository on GitHub. i have used the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template). 

If working locally, set up a virtual environment and open your project in your IDE. For virtual environment setup, you can use the command python -m venv .venv.

## **Project Setup**

Below, I have mentioned the versions of the libraries used to prevent any version incompability  issues.

1. Install **Django** and **gunicorn**:
   - `pip install Django==5.0.3 gunicorn==20.1.0`
2. Install supporting **libraries**:
   - `pip install dj-database-url==0.5.0`
   - `pip install cloudinary~=1.36.0 dj3-cloudinary-storage~=0.0.6 urllib3~=1.26.15`
   - `pip install psycopg2==2.9.9`
   - `pip install django-allauth==0.57.2`
   - `pip install django-summernote==0.8.20.0`
   - `pip install whitenoise==5.3.0`
3. Create **requirements.txt** file:
   - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
4. Create a Django project:
   - `django-admin startproject your_project_name` 
5. Run the local server
   - `python manage.py runserver`
   
## **Database Setup**

For the database, I am using PostgreSQL through ElephantSQL: [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).

1. Log in to your account
2. Create an instance on ElephantSQL and obtain the database URL.

## **Cloudinary Setup**

1. For Cloudinary, sign up and obtain your Cloudinary URL for media management. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)  **API Environment variable**

## **File Changes**

In settings.py, configure your database, static files, and Cloudinary settings. Include your database URL, Cloudinary URL, and secret key in your environment variables. Set up STATICFILES_STORAGE to use whitenoise for static file management. Don't forget to configure AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS to include both Django's default and allauth's authentication backends.

1. Although if you copy directly from my githuib repository the settings.py should come with all the changes i made i wanted to document my changes. Changes I made in the default **settings.py** file: 
    ```
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env

#Got the idea of automatic debug value setting from my mentor Jubril
try:
    from env import DEBUG_DEV
except ImportError:
    DEBUG_DEV = False 

DEBUG = DEBUG_DEV

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")

#allowed hosts for local ide and heroku deployment
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com',
                 '127.0.0.1',]

#https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/account/advanced.html
#settings Used for email login with allauth

ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'none'
ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'email'
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True
ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = False

STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}

#https://haiiiiiyun.github.io/django__Create_email_login_authentication_with_django-allauth_in_Django/

#Don't forget to configure AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS to include both Django's default and allauth's authentication backends.

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',  
    'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',
]

#check your installed app settings against my settings
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'allauth.socialaccount',
    'django_summernote',
    'menu',
    'reservations',
    'home',
    'django_rename_app',
    'cloudinary',
    'notifications',
    ]

#Templates directory code change
TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
        .
        .
        .
        },
]
    ```

2. Create a **env.py** file in your main directory copy the contents below into your file. Make sure the file is added to *.gitignore*:
    ```
    import os

    DEBUG_DEV=True

    os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "Your_url")

    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "Your_url")

    os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "Your_url")
    ```
3. After these changes, run `python manage.py migrate` to migrate your database structure to the database.

## **Heroku Setup**

1. Create a Heroku app.
2. Link your GitHub repository to Heroku.
3. Select your created app and open the *Settings* tab 
4. At the *Config Vars* section click *Reveal Config Vars* and add the following:
   - **DATABASE_URL** with the copied URL from ElephantSQL
   - **SECRET_KEY** with your secret key
   - **PORT** with the value 8000
   - **CLOUDINARY_URL** with the copied URL from Cloudinary
5. Click on *Deploy Branch* at the bottom of the page

## **Forking**

Forking creates a copy of the project on GitHub. Follow these steps to fork this repository:
1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to [Ege restaurant Repository]().
