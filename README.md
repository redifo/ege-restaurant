# Design Choices

## Colour Scheme

#F1DFA2 (Cream): This soft cream color forms the background of various sections, offering a warm and inviting ambiance that's easy on the eyes.
#FCF6E4 (Off-White): Used for background highlights and to create a clean, uncluttered look, enhancing the content's readability.
Accent Colours:
#F8DA2E (Sunflower Yellow): Used for menu title to draw attention.
#519CEB (Sky Blue): Indicates active page links and button hovers, adding a refreshing contrast against the warmer tones.
Text:
#000000 (Black): Provides excellent readability against the lighter background shades, used for the majority of the text.
This colour scheme was selected to balance warmth and energy, creating an inviting digital environment that's both aesthetically pleasing and functional. The use of contrasting colours for interactive elements ensures users can easily navigate and interact with the website.


## Typography

For the website, I chose two main fonts to make it look modern and easy to read. I used 'Work Sans' for the main text because it's clean and straightforward, which helps with reading on screens. Then, for the titles in the footer, I picked 'Dancing Script' because it's a bit more decorative and adds some personality, especially for important sections. These choices help make the site feel welcoming and easy to navigate.
